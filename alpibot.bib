abstract = {A new human and robot interface tool, so-called Navi-Guider, which makes it easy to handle mobile robots, is presented in this paper. The Navi-Guider is easily mounted on a mobile robot and is able to detect a length and a direction of the tether pulled out by a user. Those detected factors are utilized for the robot guidance and control. This paper addresses detailed hardware and software architecture of the Navi-Guider and demonstrates the practical usability of the system through actual experimental tests. The new device, Navi- Guider, is an intuitive control tool for moving mobile robots from a place to another place just by pulling the tether.},

@inproceedings{Rekleitis2001,
abstract = {We consider the problem of map learning while maintaining ground-truth pose estimates. Map learning is important in tasks that require a model of the environment or some of its features. As a robot collects data, uncertainty about its position accumulates and corrupts its knowledge of the positions from which observations are taken. We address this problem by employing cooperative localization; that is, deploying a second robot to observe the other as it explores, thereby establishing a virtual tether, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robot's position while it constructs the map. This paper presents our approach to this problem in the context of learning a set of visual landmarks useful for pose estimation. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our results experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method.},

abstract = {Home Oxygen Therapy (H.O.T.) is a medical treatment for severe lung diseases in which the patients are supplied concentrated oxygen. This paper investigates the use of a follower robot as a support device for H.O.T. patients, consisting of a two-wheeled differential drive robot connected to the user by tether. Two different control algorithms were studied using dynamic simulation and motion capture experiments with healthy subjects. In further experiments with H.O.T. patients, including a questionnaire survey, it was confirmed that Follow the Leader control was capable of following the user's trajectory more accurately than Pseudo-Joystick control, and that overall H.O.T. patients showed a preference for Follow the Leader control.},

@article{Hirata2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a passive mobile robot called PRP (Passive Robot Porter) to realize transportation of an object in cooperation with human, which is developed based on a concept of passive robotics. PRP consists of three omni-directional wheels with servo brakes and a controller. It can manipulate an object by controlling an external force/moment applied by a human based on the control of the servo brakes. We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that several motion functions of PRP are realized based on the applied force. This allows PRP to track a path which includes motion perpendicular to the pushing direction of the human without using servo motors. The impedance-based motion control is also realized with respect to the perpendicular to the pushing direction. These functions are implemented on PRP experimentally, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of PRP and its control method. {\textcopyright} 2009 VSP.},

abstract = {Conventional human motion tracking techniques based on optical systems reports important limitations for mobile applications (e.g. small spatial covering, poor environment flexibility). The present paper addresses a novel approach for optical motion tracking in open space. The measurement unit is transferred from its stationary basis onto a robotic moving platform. The platform design and limitations are described in the first place. It follows a comparative analysis of the measurement data accuracy for the stationary and mobile system. Post-processing techniques to convert acquired motion from the platform coordinate system into the ground's absolute one are evaluated for the specific application of gait analysis.},

We discuss some of the new technological challenges created by this merger and conclude that a truly holistic view is needed but currently lacking.},
