abstract = {A new human and robot interface tool, so-called Navi-Guider, which makes it easy to handle mobile robots, is presented in this paper. The Navi-Guider is easily mounted on a mobile robot and is able to detect a length and a direction of the tether pulled out by a user. Those detected factors are utilized for the robot guidance and control. This paper addresses detailed hardware and software architecture of the Navi-Guider and demonstrates the practical usability of the system through actual experimental tests. The new device, Navi- Guider, is an intuitive control tool for moving mobile robots from a place to another place just by pulling the tether.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of map learning while maintaining ground-truth pose estimates. Map learning is important in tasks that require a model of the environment or some of its features. As a robot collects data, uncertainty about its position accumulates and corrupts its knowledge of the positions from which observations are taken. We address this problem by employing cooperative localization; that is, deploying a second robot to observe the other as it explores, thereby establishing a virtual tether, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robot's position while it constructs the map. This paper presents our approach to this problem in the context of learning a set of visual landmarks useful for pose estimation. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our results experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method.},

Two different control algorithms were studied using dynamic simulation and motion capture experiments with healthy subjects. In further experiments with H.O.T. patients, including a questionnaire survey, it was confirmed that Follow the Leader control was capable of following the user's trajectory more accurately than Pseudo-Joystick control, and that overall H.O.T. patients showed a preference for Follow the Leader control.},

@article{Hirata2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a passive mobile robot called PRP (Passive Robot Porter) to realize transportation of an object in cooperation with human, which is developed based on a concept of passive robotics. PRP consists of three omni-directional wheels with servo brakes and a controller. It can manipulate an object by controlling an external force/moment applied by a human based on the control of the servo brakes. We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each wheel based on the brake force/moment constraint so that several motion functions of PRP are realized based on the applied force. This allows PRP to track a path which includes motion perpendicular to the pushing direction of the human without using servo motors. The impedance-based motion control is also realized with respect to the perpendicular to the pushing direction. These functions are implemented on PRP experimentally, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of PRP and its control method. {\textcopyright} 2009 VSP.},

abstract = {Assistive technology is an emerging area, where robotic devices can help individuals with motor disabilities to achieve independence in daily activities. This paper deals with a system that provides remote control of Sony AIBO, a commercial mobile robot, within the assistive project ASPICE. The robot can be controlled by various input devices, including a Brain-Computer Interface. AIBO has been chosen for its friendly-looking aspect, in order to ease interaction with the patients. The development of the project is described by focusing on the design of the robot navigation system. Single step, semi-autonomous and autonomous navigation modes have been realized to provide different levels of control. Automatic collision avoidance is integrated in all cases. Other features of the system, such as the video feedback from the robotic platform to the user, and the use of AIBO as communication aid, are briefly described. The performance of the navigation system is shown by simulations as well as experiments. The system has been clinically validated, in order to obtain a definitive assessment through patient feedback. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Fasola2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and user study evaluation of a socially assistive robot (SAR) system designed to engage elderly users in physical exercise aimed at achieving health benefits and improving quality of life. We discuss our design methodology, which incorporates insights from psychology research in the area of intrinsic motivation, and focuses on maintaining engagement through personalized social interaction. We describe two user studies conducted to test the motivation theory in practice with our system. The first study investigated the role of praise and relational discourse in the exercise system by comparing a relational robot coach to a nonrelational robot coach. The second study evaluated participant preferences regarding user choice in the task scenario. Both studies served to evaluate the feasibility and overall effectiveness of the robot exercise system. The results of both studies are presented; they show a strong user preference for the relational over the nonrelational robot in terms of enjoyableness, companionship, and as an exercise coach, varying user preferences regarding choice, and high user ratings of the system across multiple metrics. The outcomes of the presented user studies, brought together, support the motivational capabilities of the robot, and demonstrate the viability and usefulness of the system in motivating exercise in elderly users. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Objective. To investigate the technical and clinical viability of using computer-facilitated mental practice in the rehabilitation of upper-limb hemiparesis following stroke. Design. A single-case study. Setting. Academic-affiliated rehabilitation center. Participant. A 46-year-old man with stable motor deficit of the upper right limb following subcortical ischemic stroke. Intervention. Three computer-enhanced mental practice sessions per week at the rehabilitation center, in addition to usual physical therapy. A custom-made virtual reality system equipped with arm-tracking sensors was used to guide mental practice. The system was designed to superimpose over the (unseen) paretic arm a virtual reconstruction of the movement registered from the nonparetic arm. The laboratory intervention was followed by a 1-month home-rehabilitation program, making use of a portable display device. Main outcome measures. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical assessment measures were the upper-extremity scale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Sensorimotor Impairment and the Action Research Arm Test. Performance of the affected arm was evaluated using the healthy arm as the control condition. Results. The patient's paretic limb improved after the first phase of intervention, with modest increases after home rehabilitation, as indicated by functional assessment scores and sensors data. Conclusion. Results suggest that technology-supported mental training is a feasible and potentially effective approach for improving motor skills after stroke.

Different working environments and applications pose diverse challenges by adding constraints on the choice of sensors, degree of autonomy, and dynamics of a person-following robot. Researchers have addressed these challenges in many ways and contributed to the development of a large body of literature. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the literature by categorizing different aspects of person-following by autonomous robots. Also, the corresponding operational challenges are identified based on various design choices for ground, underwater, and aerial scenarios. In addition, state-of-the-art methods for perception, planning, control, and interaction are elaborately discussed and their applicability in varied operational scenarios is presented. Then some of the prominent methods are qualitatively compared, corresponding practicalities are illustrated, and their feasibility is analyzed for various use cases. Furthermore, several prospective application areas are identified, and open problems are highlighted for future research. }
