abstract = {Oscillations are a prevalent feature of brain recordings. They are believed to play key roles in neural communication and computation. Current analysis methods for studying neural oscillations often implicitly assume that the oscillations are sinusoidal. While these approaches have proven fruitful, we show here that there are numerous instances in which neural oscillations are nonsinusoidal. We highlight approaches to characterize nonsinusoidal features and account for them in traditional spectral analysis. Instead of being a nuisance, we discuss how these nonsinusoidal features may provide crucial and so far overlooked physiological information related to neural communication, computation, and cognition.},

abstract = {AbstractResearch in brain-computer interfaces has achieved impressive progress towards implementing assistive technologies for restoration or substitution of lost motor capabilities, as well as supporting technologies for able-bodied subjects. Notwithstanding this progress, effective translation of these interfaces from proof-of-concept prototypes into reliable applications remains elusive. As a matter of fact, most of the current BCI systems cannot be used independently for long periods of time by their intended end-users. Multiple factors that inhibit the achievement of this goal have already been identified. However, it is not clear how they affect the overall BCI performance or how they should be tackled. This is worsened by publication bias, where only positive results are disseminated, preventing the research community from learning from its errors. This paper is the result of a workshop held at the 6th International BCI meeting in Asilomar. We summarize here the discussion on concrete research aven...},

We developed a method based on dynamic time warping (DTW). The method was applied to ERPs recorded from normal and dyslexic children during two reading tasks. We found that characteristic latency and amplitude changes of ERP components are due to task and pathology. Our results support the idea that dyslexia involves different and complex cerebral functions aside from the language system.

@article{Ouyang2017,
abstract = {The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Permutation entropy (PeEn) is a complexity measure that originated from dynamical systems theory. Specifically engineered to be robustly applicable to real-world data, the quantity has since been utilised for a multitude of time series analysis tasks. In electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, value changes of PeEn correlate with clinical observations, among them the onset of epileptic seizures or the loss of consciousness induced by anaesthetic agents. Regarding this field of application, the present work suggests a relation between PeEn-based complexity estimation and spectral methods of EEG analysis: for ordinal patterns of three consecutive samples, the PeEn of an epoch of EEG appears to approximate the centroid of its weighted power spectrum. To substantiate this proposition, a systematic approach based on redundancy reduction is introduced and applied to sleep and epileptic seizure EEG. The interrelation demonstrated may aid the interpretation of PeEn in EEG, and may increase its comparability with other techniques of EEG analysis.},

The neuropsychological origins of the P3a and P3b subcomponents are detailed, and how target/standard discrimination difficulty modulates scalp topography is discussed. The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted. Neuroinhibition is suggested as an overarching theoretical mechanism for P300, which is elicited when stimulus detection engages memory operations. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a novel method to investigate P300 variability over different trials. The method incorporates spatial correlation between EEG channels to form a cooperative coupled particle filtering method that tracks the P300 subcomponents, P3a and P3b, over trials. Using state space systems, the amplitude, latency, and width of each subcomponent are modeled as the main underlying parameters. With four electrodes, two coupled Rao-Blackwellised particle filter pairs are used to recursively estimate the system state over trials. A number of physiological constraints are also imposed to avoid generating invalid particles in the estimation process. Motivated by the bilateral symmetry of ERPs over the brain, the channels further share their estimates with their neighbors and combine the received information to obtain a more accurate and robust solution. The proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the P300 subcomponents in single trials and outperforms its non-cooperative counterpart.},

@article{Ben-Simon2013,
abstract = {The unique role of the EEG alpha rhythm in different states of cortical activity is still debated. The main theories regarding alpha function posit either sensory processing or attention allocation as the main processes governing its modulation. Closing and opening eyes, a well-known manipulation of the alpha rhythm, could be regarded as attention allocation from inward to outward focus though during light is also accompanied by visual change. To disentangle the effects of attention allocation and sensory visual input on alpha modulation, 14 healthy subjects were asked to open and close their eyes during conditions of light and of complete darkness while simultaneous recordings of EEG and fMRI were acquired. Thus, during complete darkness the eyes-open condition is not related to visual input but only to attention allocation, allowing direct examination of its role in alpha modulation. A data-driven ridge regression classifier was applied to the EEG data in order to ascertain the contribution of the alpha rhythm to eyes-open/eyes-closed inference in both lighting conditions. Classifier results revealed significant alpha contribution during both light and dark conditions, suggesting that alpha rhythm modulation is closely linked to the change in the direction of attention regardless of the presence of visual sensory input. Furthermore, fMRI activation maps derived from an alpha modulation time-course during the complete darkness condition exhibited a right frontal cortical network associated with attention allocation. These findings support the importance of top-down processes such as attention allocation to alpha rhythm modulation, possibly as a prerequisite to its known bottom-up processing of sensory input.},

	learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast,
	non-parametric nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require
	no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the
	large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered
	NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness
	of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably
	undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification
	methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers:
	(i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words
	", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead
	of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier
	- NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances
	in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space
	of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without
	descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes
	assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately
	approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient,

	real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS,
	and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each
	of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire
	about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette
	consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the
	flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N = 81) of the subjects were
	able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%}
	(N = 38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC
	paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character
	correctly. People who slept less than 8 h performed significantly
	better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and
	cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to
	differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters
	was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not
	disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling
	accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately
	5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects,
	and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of
	the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A
	similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that
	only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}.
	These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts
	of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery
	BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study
	should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their
	accuracy levels are similar. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	the early-latency N1 wave of LEPs is often difficult to measure reliably,
	because of its small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus producing
	unavoidable biases in the interpretation of the results. Here, we
	aimed to develop a method to enhance the SNR of the N1 wave and measure
	its peak latency and amplitude in both average and single-trial waveforms.
	We obtained four main findings. First, we suggest that the N1 wave
	can be better detected using a central-frontal montage (Cc-Fz), as
	compared to the recommended temporal-frontal montage (Tc-Fz). Second,
	we show that the N1 wave is optimally detected when the neural activities
	underlying the N2 wave, which interfere with the scalp expression
	of the N1 wave, are preliminary isolated and removed using independent
	component analysis (ICA). Third, we show that after these N2-related
	activities are removed, the SNR of the N1 wave can be further enhanced
	using a novel approach based on wavelet filtering. Fourth, we provide
	quantitative evidence that a multiple linear regression approach
	can be applied to these filtered waveforms to obtain an automatic,
	reliable and unbiased estimate of the peak latency and amplitude
	of the N1 wave, both in average and single-trial waveforms. ?? 2009

	To treat this sequelae, alternative rehabilitation techniques are

	It can be used as a novel tool in easy setup clinical routines, to
	improve the rehabilitation process by mean of detecting patientÂ´s
	motor intention, performing it by FES and finally receiving appropriate
	feedback The BCI-FES system presented here, consists of three blocks:
	the first one decodes the patientÂ´s intention and it is composed
	by the patient, the acquisition hardware and the processing software
	(Emotiv EPOC{\textregistered}). The second block, based on Arduino's
	technology, transforms the information into a valid command signal.
	The last one excites the patientÂ´s neuromuscular system by means
	of a FES device. In order to evaluate the cerebral activity sensed
	by the device, topographic maps were obtained. The BCI-FES system
	was able to detect the patientÂ´s motor intention and control the
	FES device. At the time of this publication, the system it's being
	employing in a rehabilitation program with patients post stroke.},

	brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating
	protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators,
	biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the
	BC12000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI
	implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000
	to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing
	methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function
	well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent
	real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing
	labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different
	BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available
	with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational
	purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many
	research groups.},

  abstract = {"This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes
	that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth
	edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded;
	however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls
	of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic
	analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording,
	laboratories have collected new and different "technical artifacts."
	We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts
	in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this
	and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested
	in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring
	units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred
	in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative
	intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication
	and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed
	and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for
	well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients'
	conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations
	may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients'
	outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology
	for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular
	therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet
	communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic
	function during critical periods of operations, again with a time
	course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful
	time frame"-Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {In the last 15 years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer
	Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence
	has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer
	hardware and software is now available and can support the complex
	high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another
	factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system
	including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional
	correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these
	signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and
	perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs
	and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy,
	spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
	multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled
	are now able to live for many years and even those with severely
	limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic
	means of communication and control because of the recent advances
	in the technology, research, and applications of BCI. This book is
	intended to provide an introduction to and summary of essentially
	all major aspects of BCI research and development. Its goal is to
	be a comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated presentation of the
	field's key principles, current practice, and future prospects.},
